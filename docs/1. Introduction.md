# PyBridge - Bridge to the other side
## Overview
PyBridge - Bridge to the other side, is a Python-based Event-Driven Script PyBridge (ESB) designed to facilitate the execution of scripts based on various triggers such as timers, schedules, or API calls. This project, based on Flask, is currently a work in progress.

## Features
- **API Triggers:** Trigger script execution through API calls
- **Tokens:** Control execution rights

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x
- Install the required dependencies with the method listed below

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/thatsleepyman/PyBridge.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```cmd
cd PyBridge
```

3. Install the required dependencies in '``PyBridge/.venv``'
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Understanding Tokens
- **MASTER_TOKEN:** Acts like a license key, granting the requestor the right to send requests to PyBridge
- **PYROCESS_TOKEN:** Allows the requestor to send data to and trigger PyRocesses
    - Every PyRocess in every environment `(main/ dev/ test)` has their own separate PyRocess token
- **DEVELOPER_TOKEN:** Used by 'Developers' to trigger PyRocesses through the `{ip}:{port}/PyBridge/dev/{PyRocess}` routing
- **USER_TOKEN:** Used by 'Users' to trigger PyRocesses through the `{ip}:{port}/PyBridge/main/{PyRocess}` routing
- **TESTER_TOKEN:** Used by 'Testers' to trigger PyRocesses through the `{ip}:{port}/PyBridge/test/{PyRocess}` routing
> [!NOTE] > For more information about Tokens, see ``config/tokens_main.json``.

## Note
PyBridge assumes that there is a **'.venv'** directory in the root directory of the project ('``PyBridge/.venv``'). Please create one and install the Python modules there. If you prefer to not use a '**.venv**', then you'll have to slightly tweak the code.
