# What is the scope of this project?
The scope of this project is to develop a Python-based ``Event-Driven Script Bridge`` (ESB) named **PyBridge**. The main purpose of **PyBridge** is to facilitate the execution of scripts based on various triggers such as ``timers``, ``schedules``, or ``API calls``. The project is currently a work in progress and is based on the ``Flask`` framework.

## What should PyBridge do:
- [ ] Just a simple ESB which you can use to trigger scripts through endpoints that are callable with Tokens

## What won't PyBridge do:
