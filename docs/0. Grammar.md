In the context of this project, there are several key terms and tokens that you should be familiar with:

## Explanation:
### PyBridge:
- **PyBridge.py:** This is the main application
- **Request.py:** The HTTP request script that is used to ``trigger`` API processes.
- **set_in_stone.py:** This is a flexible logger function that is used to log the different types of processes, requests and functions.

### Tokens:
- **MASTER_TOKEN:** Acts like a license key, granting the requestor the right to send requests to PyBridge.
- **DEVELOPER_TOKEN:** Allows the requestor to send data to and trigger DEV PyRocesses.
- **USER_TOKEN:** Allows the requestor to send data to and trigger MAIN PyRocesses.
- **TESTER_TOKEN:** Allows the requestor to send data to and trigger TEST PyRocesses.
- **PYROCESS_TOKEN:** Allows the requestor to send data to and trigger a specific PyRocesses.

### Heartbeat Monitor:
TBA
- The **Heartbeat Monitor** is a separate project that isn't directly related to **PyBridge**, however it does play a critical role in the stability and reliability of **PyBridge**.
	- The usage of the **Heartbeat Monitor** will be to read the ``Pulse`` of **PyBridge** at a set interval and create a ``GitHub Issue`` and send a ``SMS Alert`` if **PyBridge** does not respond with a ``Pulse``.

### Other lingo:
- **PyRocesses:** This is a combination of ``Py`` (short for Python) and the word ``Processes``. This is used to describe the scripts you can trigger through PyBridge.
