In the context of this project, there are several key terms and tokens that you should be familiar with:

## Explanation:
### PyBridge:
- **PyBridge.py:** This is the main ESB application.
* **request_{env}.py:** These are the HTTP request scripts that are used to ``trigger`` API-Triggered PyRocesses.

### Tokens:
- **MASTER_TOKEN:** Acts like a license key, granting the requestor the right to send requests to PyBridge.
- **DEVELOPER_TOKEN:** Used to change settings within **PyBridge**, such as enabling or disabling processes or triggering ``DEV`` PyRocesses.
- **USER_TOKEN:** Allows the requestor to send data to and trigger ``MAIN`` PyRocesses
- **TESTER_TOKEN:** Allows the requestor to send data to and trigger ``TEST`` PyRocesses
- **PYROCESS_TOKEN:** Allows the requestor to send data to and trigger a specific PyRocesses.

### Other lingo:
* **PyRocesses:** This is a combination of ``Py`` (short for Python) and the word ``Processes``.
* **ESB:** ``E``vent-driven ``S``cript ``B``ridge, an application used to create endpoints, send and receive data.
